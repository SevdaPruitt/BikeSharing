# BikeSharing

On this project, I am helping out Kate on her business proposal regarding to a proof of concept for a business. To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, to solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. Below is a quick display of data we had.

Results:

For the shortest bike checkout times of zero, one, or two minutes, less than a minute has the highest peak.
